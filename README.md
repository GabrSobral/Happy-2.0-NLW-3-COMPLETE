# Happy 2.0
This project was developed during the Next Level Week 3.

# About the project

Happy is a Web and Mobile application that allows users to register and find orphanages. Visiting users are offered details of the orphanage, such as times and instructions for visiting the orphanage.

This project was conceived thinking about the 12th of October, where Children's Day is celebrated, created in order to help users find orphanages and bring joy to children.

This application was developed during the Next Level Week # 3, a Rocketseat project.
